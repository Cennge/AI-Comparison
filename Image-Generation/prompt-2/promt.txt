Transform the uploaded reference object into a classic blueprint render while keeping the object’s silhouette and proportions accurate. Convert it into a deep blueprint-blue sheet with subtle paper grain and faint fold marks, and redraw the object as crisp technical linework in white and pale-cyan: clean vector-like outlines, inner construction lines, dashed hidden edges, centerlines, and precise crosshatching where needed. Add realistic drafting annotations around the object: dimension lines with arrowheads, measurement ticks, section marks, callout numbers in small circles, and a minimal title block in the bottom-right with placeholders (no real brand names). Keep the object centered, straight-on or slight isometric technical view, high clarity, sharp edges, no photo texture, no shading like a photo, only blueprint-style linework. Add very subtle scan noise and slight vignette like a scanned architectural blueprint. No extra objects, no watermarks, no unrelated text.
