Use the uploaded reference image as the main subject and convert it into a premium keychain charm. The charm must clearly match the reference subject’s silhouette and key colors, but be manufactured as a physical keychain piece: glossy acrylic, polished resin, or enamel-filled metal with a high-gloss clearcoat. Make the charm very shiny and reflective with strong, clean specular highlights, subtle light bloom, and realistic reflections. Optionally add a soft inner glow (neon-like edge glow) that matches the reference colors, but keep it physically plausible and not overpowering. Include realistic thickness, beveled edges, and a clean cut outline. If the reference includes text or graphics, treat them as embossed/engraved or printed inlay on the charm.
The metal keyring must ALWAYS be visible in the frame: a complete circular ring at the top, fully inside the crop, connected with a short chain and metal links. Use correct scale and believable gravity so the charm hangs naturally from the ring. Studio product photo: pure black background, crisp focus, realistic specular highlights on the ring and chain, subtle micro scratches, soft reflections, and a gentle shadow. Ultra realistic commercial product look. No hands, no extra props, no watermarks, no unrelated text or logos.
